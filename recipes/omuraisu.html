    <h2>Ketchup and Eggs? A Match Made in Heaven?</h2>

        <p>Omuraisu is similar in flavor and style to hash browns 
            and eggs. This delicious Japanese dish works wonderfully 
            as a breakfast, lunch, or dinner, especially for those 
            not ready for the traditional raw fish or white rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup cooked white or brown rice</li>
                <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>1 slice processed cheese food (optional)</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup, ham, and cheese, if using. Cook and stir 
                    until ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 8 minutes. Scoop mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. 
                    As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely 
                    set, remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Place omelet on top of rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of omelet. It should open like a butterfly and drape over rice. 
                    Top with final tablespoon of ketchup and a sprinkle of parsley.</li>
            </ol>
